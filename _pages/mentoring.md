Proud to mentor a number of PhD students, each possessing an inquisitive mind seeking to find solutions to challenging research questions. A number of my recent research papers features these bright young minds as my co-authors.

## Current PhD student

### Chandan Biswas

[Chandan Biswas](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=W2JbsRQAAAAJ&hl=en) is a PhD student of mine registered at the [Indian Statistical Institute](https://www.isical.ac.in/). I co-supervise his PhD along with [Ujjwal Bhattacharya](https://www.isical.ac.in/~ujjwal/). Chandan's work investigates how to develop both unsupervised and supervised learning models under privacy preservation constraints (specifically useful in a distributed computing environment in an untrusted network).

## Mentored students

### Procheta Sen

[Procheta Sen](https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~sprocheta/) is a PhD student registered at the [School of Computing, Dublin City University](https://www.computing.dcu.ie/), Dublin, Ireland. Her PhD supervisor is [Gareth J.F. Jones](https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~gjones/), who in the past was my PhD supervisor as well. In her PhD studies, she is investigating effective ways to model and evaluate *proactive information retrieval* (i.e. zero-query information retrieval). She is also interested in embedding algorithms and multi-objective neural learning.  

### Anirban Chakraborty

[Anirban Chakraborty](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/~achakrab/) is a PhD student at the [School of Computer Science, Trinity College Dublin](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/). His PhD topic includes investigating information retrieval (IR) based approaches for effective points-of-interest (POI) recommendation.

### Suchana Dutta

[Suchana Dutta ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suchana-datta-94ba942b/) is a PhD student at University College, Dublin. With her I'm pursuing novel search interfaces and algorithms towards addressing causality driven search, i.e. where a search user wants to find out documents answering the *Why* question, e.g. *why was Osama bin Laden assassinated?* etc. 

### Swarup Chattopadhyay

[Swarup Chattopadhay](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=7PI1amoAAAAJ) is a PhD student at the [Indian Statistical Institute](https://www.isical.ac.in/). With Swarup, I'm investigating faster and more effective solutions of standard graph problems, such as clique, coloring, community funding etc. using embedded representations of graphs.


## Past PhD student

[Dwaipayan Roy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zmc1M2UAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) graduated out of the [Indian Statistical Institute](https://www.isical.ac.in/) with his PhD degree in 2019. He was the first PhD student of mine (co-supervised by [Mandar Mitra](https://www.isical.ac.in/~mandar/)). His PhD investigated the use of embedded word representations for the purpose of improving retrieval effectiveness.
